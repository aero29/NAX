# NAX
A unique design system for non-axisymmetric turbomachinery design and development. 
NAX is highly paramteric in nature and can easily be intgrated to Analysis(CFD) or/and Optimization process.Because of its modular and paramteric design , NAX is highly customizable .

It uses Discrete Fourier Transforms to calculate the perturbations in blade properties like Leading edge angle, Trailing edge angle, tangential/ axisymmetric Lean and Sweep. 

The package comes with complete documentation and system requires Python v2.7 and Shell ( Unix environmemt). Windows OS users can use Cygwin.
